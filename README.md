## Elevate Your API development Experience with jestpress!

[jestpress](<'[README.md](https://github.com/satilpereira/jestpress#readme)'>) is not just a boilerplate, it's your launchpad into the future of API development. Unleash the power of mvc architecture and effortlessly organize your project for success.

## üé® Features

- **MVC architecture**: Organize your components utilizing the model view controller architecture.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Jestpress works by setting up a new Node express application with the MVC architecture. To get started, install jestpress globally:

```bash
npm install -g jestpress
```

## üö¶ Usage

Generate a new application effortlessly:

```bash
# Create a new application in the current directory
jestpress create ./
```

Or specify a folder:

```bash
# Create a new application in a specified directory
jestpress create my-api
```

## üèóÔ∏è MVC architecture

[jestpress](<'[README.md](https://github.com/satilpereira/jestpress#readme)'>) follows the mvc architecture. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

```bash
/api # API folder contains all your application logic
-- /v1 # API version 1
-- -- /models # Models for the API
```
